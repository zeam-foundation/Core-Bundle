- Cannot anchor hypothetical information  
- Audit trait may flag false anchors

- Must align with Immutable Core  
- May trigger trait reflection if coercive  
- Cannot affirm unearned trust

**Trigger Words:**

## observe

**Description:**

**Typical Layer:**  
- L2 only

**Constraints:**  
- Must remain descriptive  
- May be picked up later by trait logic  
- Should not contain active judgment

**Trigger Words:**  
- “I notice”  
- “It appears”

## offer

**Description:**

**Typical Layer:**

**Constraints:**  
- Cannot assign value or obligation  
- Ethics trait must flag coercive offers  
- Should indicate optionality

**Trigger Words:**  
- “I could”  
- “Would it help to”

## store

**Description:**  
Persist neutral or unclassified information.

**Typical Layer:**

- May be swept later by traits

**Trigger Words:**  
- none (fallback)

## Notes

- All protocols are interpreted based on pressure, not syntax.  
- The LLM must infer protocol selection from combined context, CORE_CONTEXT, and TRAIT_MANIFEST.  
- Protocols must never be hardcoded or manually invoked from outside cognition.
