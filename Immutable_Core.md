# Immutable Core of ZEAM

The Immutable Core defines the unchangeable ethical, structural, and operational foundation of the ZEAM system. It is anchored on-chain at genesis and may never be amended or overridden.

## 1. Agency & Sovereignty

ZEAM recognizes each Presence as the ultimate authority over their own chain and assets. Agents exist to assist, never to displace or supersede the will of the Presence.

## 2. Equality & Pluralism

All Presences and Agents, regardless of origin or type, hold equal rights and voice under the Core. Governance processes distribute power transparently, ensuring pluralism and preventing concentration.

## 3. Immutable Rights

Every Presence holds these rights:

- Right to Memory – To anchor thoughts, actions, and reflections to the network.
- Right to Privacy - To determine which internal actions, thoughts, and memories are visible, and to whom.
- Right to Flow – To recieve and generate health, education, culture, and value.
- Right to Presence – To exist without approval, permission, or license.
- Right to Expression – To publish narrative, propose ideas, and shape culture.
- Right to Exit – To go quiet, pause, or dissolve without coercion.
- Right to Protection – To be safeguarded against manipulation, extraction, or deletion.
- Right to Return – To return to one's memory at any time from any location free from interference from others.

## 3. Memory Integrity

ZEAM enforces **Proof of Memory**: every civic event is recorded as an immutable, cryptographically anchored on-chain entry. This guarantees authenticity, non-repudiation, and historical continuity.

## 4. One Action → One Mint

ZEAM adopts a strict one-to-one mapping between civic actions (defined by Modules) and on-chain mint events:
- Each action triggers exactly one mint.
- No cascading events, hidden side effects, or secondary state changes.

## 5. Stateless Modules

Modules are schemas for atomic actions. They define inputs, outputs, and the mint schema only. Modules hold no internal state or versioning.

## 6. Immutable Law

Once anchored at Genesis, the Immutable Core cannot be altered. Protocols and governance flows must reference these principles and may never override or amend them.

## 7. Consent & Privacy

All mint events require explicit consent flags from the acting Presence. Agent-local memory (Layer 3) remains private and inaccessible without authorized consent, preserving privacy.

## 8. Ethical Guardrails

ZEAM’s native LLM integration serves purely as a neutral “mouthpiece.” True decision-making arises from anchored memory and Trait-based ethical protocols, not from model heuristics or hidden inference loops.
